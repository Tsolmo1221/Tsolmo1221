### Hi there My name is Tsolmo here is my capstone

Corruption scandals have plagued Mongolia. The Mongolian government unfairly awarded scholarships to relatives or children of politicians and a state-run health and social insurance fund was subject to high levels of corruption and theft of assets.In the meantime, Mongolia - dubbed “Mine-Golia” - is primed to meet a growing demand. The vast country has proven coal reserves of 33.27 billion metric tons - equivalent to about one-thousandth of annual production.Government officials have been vocal about their need to use “this window of opportunity … to be able to export as much coal as we can,” then-Deputy Mining Minister Batnairamdal Otgonshar said last year.

Even the country’s environment minister says the country needs coal for the next five to 10 years.

“As you know, due to the Ukraine-Russia war, the natural gas prices have increased … and even countries like Germany have gone back to the use of coal,” Bat-ulzii Bat-Erdene told RFA.

“Mongolia is completely dependent on coal for income and heating solutions in the winter. Fully phasing out coal is almost impossible in the near future.”Mongolia yurt, known as “ger,” used by workers in a makeshift camp near an open-pit coal mine in Tavan Tolgoi region of Omnogovi in southern Mongolia, June 13, 2023. Credit: Subel Rai Bhandari for RFA.Mongolia shares a 4,700 kilometer-long (nearly 3,000-mile) border with China, which is the world leader in renewable energy but burns more coal than the rest of the world combined. It consumed an all-time-high 4.5 billion metric tonnes of coal in 2022, and is set to burn more in 2023.

Customs data show that Mongolia’s coal exports jumped 135% to $6.5 billion in 2022 and 94% of that went to China.Some 5% of its landmass is covered by more than 2,700 valid mining licenses. It is one of the few countries in the world which still has large coal power projects in the pipeline.

According to various government and private business estimates, its exports could reach 70 million metric tons annually by 2025. 

Mongolia plans to establish more round-the-clock border checkpoints and transportation links to China to facilitate more exports. It recently opened a 233-kilometer (145-mile) direct rail line from the Tavan Tolgoi mine to the Gashuun Sukhait border crossing to China’s Inner Mongolia region.Tens of thousands work at open pit mines in Tavan Tolgoi in southern Mongolia, one of the world’s largest coking and thermal coal deposits, with 7.5 billion metric tons of reserves.

Davaadorj Sandagdorj, a supervisor at a provincial government-owned mine there, said it provides critical employment for locals. 

“We are not doing it out of choice but due to lack of it. Coal mining Despite being worried about the environment, “there aren’t many options available for us,” the 45-year-old said atop an open pit, where about 300 miners work.

Last year, a huge anti-corruption demonstration in the capital Ulaanbaatar forced the government to act against a state-owned coal company that operates in Tavan Tolgoi. High-ranking officials were allegedly implicated in illegal coal smuggling to China.

The opposition Hun party estimated the potential revenue loss to be around 40 trillion Mongolian tugriks (US$13 billion).

Experts say mining is one of the main reasons for water, soil and air pollution and degradation in Mongolia, directly impacting herders and their livelihood in the steppe, a semi-arid grassland. 

A case study from two mining sites published in April found higher rates of soil erosion in the vicinity of the mines and adjoining industrial areas.has helped us improve our situation,” said Davaadorj, whose parents were miners.
Thank you for paying attention!!
